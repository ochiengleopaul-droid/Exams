        # GOT BONDO Junior School — Exam Management (Demo)

This is a Next.js + Tailwind scaffold (demo mode) with in-memory API routes.

## How to run locally

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- The APIs are in-memory (files under `pages/api`) — data is not persisted between server restarts.
- To deploy, push to GitHub and use Vercel for automatic deployment.

## What I included
- Dashboard, Exams, Learners, Teachers pages
- Simple Navbar, an Exam creation form (client -> /api/exams)
